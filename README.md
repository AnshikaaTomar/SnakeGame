# SnakeGame
This is my first Java project using Swing and AWT. 

### Uses Java’s JPanel to draw the snake, the food, and the background. 🎨

## Handles Snake Movement ⬅️⬆️➡️⬇️
  - Listens for arrow key presses and updates the snake’s direction.
    
## Game Logic 🧠
  - Random Food Placement 🍒
  - Snake eats food 🍎
  - Grows in size 🐍➕
  - Checks for collisions (with wall or itself) 💥
  - Ends the game when the snake colllides ❌

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
  - Java Swing and AWT: for GUI 🖼️
  - KeyListener: for keyboard input 🎹
  - Timer: for animations and movement ⏱️
  - ArrayList: to store and manage snake body segments efficiently 🐍🧩
